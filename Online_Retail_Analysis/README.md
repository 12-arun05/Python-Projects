# Online Retail Analysis  

## Project Overview  
The **Online Retail Analysis** project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) study conducted on a dataset containing approximately **500,000** records. The project aims to derive insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and retention patterns.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)  
- **Google Colab** (for cloud-based analysis)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional)  

## Key Objectives  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values and duplicates  
   - Correcting data inconsistencies  
   - Formatting and optimizing data for analysis  

2. **Sales Analysis**  
   - Revenue trends over time  
   - Best-selling products and categories  
   - Top-performing countries and regions  

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Identifying customer clusters based on purchasing behavior  
   - RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis  

4. **Churn Analysis**  
   - Identifying inactive customers  
   - Understanding factors leading to customer churn  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains transaction-level details, including:  
- **Invoice No**: Unique transaction identifier  
- **Stock Code & Description**: Product details  
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold  
- **Invoice Date**: Purchase timestamp  
- **Unit Price**: Price per unit  
- **Customer ID**: Unique customer identifier  
- **Country**: Customerâ€™s country  

## Results & Insights  
- **Top products and revenue-generating categories identified**  
- **Customer segments grouped based on RFM scores**  
- **Retention strategies recommended based on churn analysis**  

## How to Run the Project  
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook  
2. Open it in **Google Colab**  
3. Upload the dataset  
4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis  

## Future Improvements  
- Advanced predictive modeling for churn prevention  
- Integration with real-time dashboards  
- More detailed time-series analysis
